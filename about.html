		<!-- A short description about me:-->
		<h3>Nice to meet you</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>My name is Ayush Sherpa, currently a student. I'm a guy driven by passion. Everything I do, I do it out of my love and passion for it. Ive been studying about programming languages and other ways of developing for a about over a year now and I really love it. The thought of creating something that can solve your problems using a bunch of line of codes really amazes me and I want to exploit this fascility to my benifit. I beleive that with <strong>hardwork</strong> and <strong>perseverance</strong> anything you put your mind to is achieveably. </p><br>

	<h3>Achievement &#38; Goals</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>From a very young age I was greatly interested in sports. I competed in many sporting events throughout my school life which ultimately lead me to start bodybuilding. Sports had alwaya played a huge role in my life by keeping me fit and active all the time and by the age of 16 I started body building. Working out has not only helped become stronger but it has also helped me become strong mentally. I always believe in having a strong mentality and setting big goals that really push you to the limit. Over the years I learned a few programming languages like C, C#, Java etc which I found to be very interesting. I studied at a bootcamp for about 5 months to learn the basics of these programming languages and also learn how they worked. </p>

		<h3>Web Development &#38; Programming</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>The first programming language I had ever learnt was QBASIC. Its a high level languge developed by Microsoft. The first web page I made was using HTML. It was a basic web page with a heading a paragraph and some color. It wasnt until I graduate from high school I started learning more complex ways of programming. I taught my self how to create small applications using JAVA and using Database to access, edit, delete and insert data using C# and MySQL. </p>
